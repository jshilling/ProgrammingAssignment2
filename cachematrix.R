## Programm Assignment 2 for "R Programming" (rprog-006)
##
## The functions cache tine inverse of a square, invertable matric
## so that it does not have to be re-calculated for every use (unless
## the matrix, and therefore it's inverse, have changed).

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
    ## This function creates a special "matrix" object
    ## that can cache its inverse.
}




cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
        ## If the inverse has already been calculated 
        ## (and the matrix has not changed), then
        ## `cacheSolve` retrieves the inverse from the cache.
